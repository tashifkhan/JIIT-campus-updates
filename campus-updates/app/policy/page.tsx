						<p>
							Students with off-campus offers <em>may</em> be permitted to join
							an "Internship with Full-time Role" or "Full-time Role Based on
							Performance" for 6 months from January 1, 2026 onwards, subject to
							specific conditions:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>A. Documentation Required:</strong> The company's HR
								must email the Head T&P with an official offer letter (on
								company letterhead) detailing:
								<ul>
									<li>Start and end dates of the internship.</li>
									<li>Stipend during the internship.</li>
									<li>The package for the full-time role.</li>

							<li>
								<strong>Disciplinary Guidelines:</strong> Separate disciplinary
								guidelines are attached for students participating in placement
								drives, which you must comply with. (The document mentions a PDF
								attachment for this).
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Interaction:</strong> Brigadier Sanjay Dawar will be
								interacting with students during March/April 2025.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways and Potential Questions</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Understand your internship status:</strong> The
								distinction between "internship only" and "internship with
								full-time role" is crucial. If you secure a PPO or a
								performance-based full-time role with your internship, you're
								out of campus placements.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Strategic Participation:</strong> If you have an offer
								below ₹4.60 Lacs, you still have broad access to higher package
								drives. If your offer is higher, your options to re-sit are more
								restricted to significantly higher packages (2x current).
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>One Offer per Level:</strong> Be mindful that you can
								only hold one offer at a specific package level. This implies
								careful decision-making if you get multiple offers within the
								same band.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Off-Campus Offers:</strong> While possible, getting an
								off-campus offer approved means you exit the campus placement
								process entirely. This is a significant commitment.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Dates are Important:</strong> Pay close attention to
								dates like June 2025, January 2026, June 2026, and May 2026/May
								25, 2026.
